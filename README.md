# Assessment of the Practicality and Effectiveness of Self-Guided Digital Resources for Families at the Museum of London

The goal of our project was to help the Museum of London capitalize on the growing use
of technology in museums by assessing whether self-guided digital resources for families are a
practical and effective means to complement visitors’ experiences. We interviewed staff and
examined digital resources at several museums in London and used their advice to guide our
development of an iPad application for the Victorian Walk gallery at the museum. After
receiving feedback from 63 families and ten museum staff, we recommended that the museum
should 1) implement more digital resources for families in its galleries, 2) further explore digital
activities to promote family learning, and 3) consider implementing resources for visitors’
personal devices.
